# fractioncollector
20180820
This file contains fraction collector code that was written to control a MakeBlock XY plotter as a fraction collector.

The .ino file is for arduino. The MeOrion.h library is a beast of a library that is provided by Makeblock for their orion arduino Uno knockoff control board. 

Use of this code is at your own risk! I make no guarantees to the validity or effectiveness of this code. Some assembly is always required when setting up someone else's code on your gear...
